# Dashboard-Tracking-COVID-19

  On the last day of December 2019, Chinese health official informed the world about the virus that can be transferred from person to person. The early studies believed that the origin of this disease was a large gathering of people at the live animal market in Wuhan. As result, Wuhan authority closed the market and banned the trade of live animal in all markets. On January 7th, Chinese authorities identified the virus as new coronavirus (called novel coronavirus COVID-19). On January 11th, China reported the first death. As a result, people began to investigate deeply to understand how the virus transmit in meanwhile China has started a large quarantine in the history, as the virus continue to spread all over the word.  The world health organization declared a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, most of the countries are still straggling with virus from partial shutdown to a lockdown hopping to slow down the spread of the invisible enemy. Even though COVID19 is officially passed the SARS in number of effected people it turns out to be more less deadly than SARS. Healthcare system is working hard to come up with the treatment but there is no cure for it at this time indeed the health official says that some specific drugs can be used but more researches are needed for better result. In waiting for the vaccine or any effective treatment
